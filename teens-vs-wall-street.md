# Why Wall Street Is Afraid of Teenagers ðŸ‘¶ðŸ“‰

Welcome to **Quanteen** â€” where Gen Z quant dreams collide with ancient finance traditions.  
Iâ€™m Dhairya Shah, and while Wall Streetâ€™s still running on 1980s coffee, Iâ€™m here to caffeinate things with code.

## ðŸš¨ The Problem

Teenagers aren't supposed to be good at options trading.  
Weâ€™re supposed to be confused about taxes and invest in NFTs because theyâ€™re "vibe-y."

But here's the thing:  
- We code  
- We understand volatility  
- We question everything  
- And some of us â€” *cough cough* â€” built trading bots before we grew facial hair

## ðŸ’¡ My Vision

Iâ€™m not here to predict markets.  
Iâ€™m here to understand their **behaviors** â€” mathematically, psychologically, algorithmically.  
Quants donâ€™t follow markets. We reverse-engineer them.

## ðŸ”§ What Youâ€™ll Find on This Repo

- Real trading logic (in code and English)
- Project breakdowns from my journey
- Rants about inefficiencies that make my eye twitch
- Finance memes because we're not that serious

## ðŸ™Œ Let's Build

Follow me, clone the repo, fork your own versions.  
Teenagers are done being broke and boring.
